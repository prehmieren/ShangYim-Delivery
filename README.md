<h1>Shangyim Restaurant with a list of food</h1>
<string>Funtions</string>
<ul>
  <li>Filter-function from types of food</li>
 
</ul>
There are still a few things to do:
<ul>
  <li>Add React Lazy Load to show photos in a smoother way</li>
  <li>Use Zustand or Redux Toolkits library to manage variables/states and fucntions</li>
  <li>Ultimate Updates would be a website for a restaurant with order-food with cart (front end final project)</li>
</ul>
